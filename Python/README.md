What Is My Dog's Age In Human Years?

dogAge.py returns a dog's age in approximate human years based on given inputs.

User Inputs
1) age: integer; current age of dog
2) weight: integer; current weight of dog

Calculations are based on data from the American Kennel Club (https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/). This program makes the following assumptions based on data from AKC:

- the 1st year of a small,med or lrg dog is equal to 15 human years. The 1st year of a giant dog is equal to 12 human years.
- the 2nd year of a small, med or lrg dog is equal to 9 human years. The 2nd year of a giant dog is equal to 12 human years.
- after that, each human year is equal to approximately 4 for a small dog, and 5 years for a med/lrg dog, and 7 years for a giant dog

Results are approximations only.
