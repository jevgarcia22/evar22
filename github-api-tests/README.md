# QA Engineer Coding Exercise

This Repository Contains:
- Tests to verify functionality of the Github /users GET endpoint. Tests are written
  in Javascript, using the SuperTest assertion library

Part 1 Questions and Answers

  What concerns would you have from a testing perspective?
   - how is the endpoint consumed?
   - performance
   - authentication

  How would you go about tackling the QA for this work?
   - I would begin by manually testing the endpoint (using Postman or Fiddler):
     - send valid and invalid data to retrieve responses

  What sort of tests would be worth describing or worth automating?
   - validate response & status code when valid data is submitted
   - validate response & status code when invalid data is submitted
   - validate response is returned in json format
   - validate response headers are as expected
   - validate response & status code when sending data via authenticated user
   - validate response & status code when sending data via un-authenticated user

  What tools would you use?
     - Postman or Fiddler to manually send requests/recieve responses from endpoints
