Part 2 Questions and Answers

2. Assume you are part of an engineering team that is building a loyalty app for a large
retailer. You are in a meeting in which the following stories are being discussed by the
product owner and engineering team:
a) As a customer, I want to enroll in the loyalty program.
b) As a program participant, I want to check my balance of reward points.
c) As a program participant, I want to redeem some of my points for a reward.
Describe how you might participate in this meeting to ensure that the development work for
these stories can be demonstrated to the product owner. What are your areas of concern?
How would you address them? Provide your answers as a PDF.

As the quality representative, my role is to:
- Ensure acceptance criteria is sufficiently defined and understood by the team.
  Given the current stories, I would ask the following questions of PdM:
  - who can enroll?
  - what data is required to enroll?
  - what is required to redeem points? (i.e, is there a minimum to be met?)
  - what can points be redeemed for?
  - are there external dependencies? (i.e, legal considerations)

Areas of concern:
- Areas to test: This should be addressed with the group.
  - would need to understand what parts of the code are being touched. Do those
    areas overlap with other areas that would require testing?
- Performance:
  - how much load should the application be able to handle?
- Security:
  - can one user see another user's data?
